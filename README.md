# Exercise_10

This project includes a collection of materials related to the implementation and analysis of the golden-section search algorithm. The golden-section search is an optimization algorithm that finds the minimum of a unimodal function.

## Contents
- `Read me` - This rft file contains the instructions.
- `Homework10_BHARDWAJ,Abhishek_QELI,Sara.pdf` - This PDF file contains the solved exercises 10.
- `GoldenSectionSearch.java` - A Java implementation of the golden-section search algorithm, designed to find the minimum value of a continuous unimodal function on a specified interval.
- `golden_section_pseudocode.rtf` - The RTF (Rich Text Format) document provides the pseudo-code for the golden-section search algorithm, which can serve as a guide to understanding the logic behind the implemented Java code.

## Getting Started

To use the contents of this project, you will need a PDF reader for the solutions file, a Java development environment to run and possibly modify the Java code, and a word processor that can open RTF files to view the pseudo-code.

### Prerequisites

- A PDF reader (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or Okular)
- JDK (Java Development Kit) for running Java code
- An IDE or text editor capable of editing Java files (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code)
- A word processor that supports RTF (such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer)
